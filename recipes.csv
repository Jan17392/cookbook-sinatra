"Crab Fat-Caramel Wings","Don't worry.you won't need to buy any crabs to make these mind-altering wings. The crab flavor comes from a jarred condiment that's pretty easy to find at Asian markets; if not, use the shrimp version.","4/4",""

"Shrimp Poached in Coconut Milk With Fresh Herbs (Yerra Moolee)","No matter what food is cooked in it or what spices are added, coconut milk never loses its distinct sweet flavor. Instead, it enriches all the other flavors. In this dish from Kerala, a state on the southwestern coast of India, fresh juicy shrimps are gently poached in herb-laced coconut milk. The spicing here is intentionally kept very subtle, so that the natural flavors of the shrimp and the coconut milk can be relished to their fullest. Yerra Moolee, with its shimmering ivory-white sauce, can be made to taste much hotter than this recipe by increasing the quantity of green chilies.","4/4",""

Strawberry Buckwheat Bars,"Use seasonal strawberries if you can get them, but even less than stellar ones will shine with the help of a jar of preserves. The combination creates beautiful ruby red candy-like edges, with a bit of ooze in the center, especially if you bake them and eat them in the same day. Just make sure they are completely cool before cutting them. Preserves usually come in either 12- or 13-ounce jars; either one will work—just use the whole jar.",4/4,//assets.epicurious.com/photos/55ac4e7398d8666b6dcdac5a/6:4/w_274%2Ch_169/EP_15072015_BARCOOKIE_strawberrybuckweatbars_6x4.jpg
Sweet Corn Ice Cream With Butterscotch,"When I was first served corn ice cream, I thought the guy who made it was having a laugh. To me, corn meant succotash, soup, and steamy ears buttered and sprinkled with crunchy sea salt. It did not mean dessert. Yet while it took me a good minute to get my head around the idea, it took me only about half a second to eat every last bit. Of course, corn ice cream makes perfect sense—corn is good mates with dairy; and during summer, the veg is sweeter than strawberries, peaches, and other fruits commonly spotted in ice cream. A healthy drizzle of butterscotch and a scattering of caramel popcorn add sweet–salty complexity and crunch.",4/4,//assets.epicurious.com/photos/577293e781b863b1392e9a98/6:4/w_274%2Ch_169/sweet-corn-ice-cream-with-butterscotch-april-bloomfield-062816.jpg
